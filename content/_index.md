# Weinan Si

I was trained as an experimental high energy physicist, I worked > 4 years for
[CMS](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) experiment, hosted on the
largest machine human ever built -- [LHC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider).

I love programming, primarily in Python and C++.
